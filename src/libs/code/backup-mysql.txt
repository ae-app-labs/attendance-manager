Execute a database backup query from PHP file

Below is an example of using SELECT INTO OUTFILE query for creating table backup : 


<?php
include 'config.php';
include 'opendb.php';

$tableName  = 'mypet';
$backupFile = 'backup/mypet.sql';
$query      = "SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '$backupFile' FROM $tableName";
$result = mysql_query($query);

include 'closedb.php';
?> 



To restore the backup you just need to run LOAD DATA INFILE query like this : 


<?php
include 'config.php';
include 'opendb.php';

$tableName  = 'mypet';
$backupFile = 'mypet.sql';
$query      = "LOAD DATA INFILE 'backupFile' INTO TABLE $tableName";
$result = mysql_query($query);

include 'closedb.php';
?> 


It's a good idea to name the backup file as tablename.sql so you'll know from which table the backup file is
